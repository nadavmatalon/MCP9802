  MCP9802 LIBRARY - PRINTABLE DEVICE INFORMATION STRING EXAMPLE
  -------------------------------------------------------------

  INTRODUCTION
  ------------
  This sketch presents a minimal example of extending the MCP9802 Library to include an additional function for generating a printable device 
  information string which may be useful, for example, during debugging sessions.

  As can be seen in the sketch below, implementation of this extended functionality only requires adding a single 'include' to the code, namely: 
  to that of the relevant *.h file (MCP9802InfoStr.h).
  
  Note that this functional extension does come at the cost of an increased memory usage, and therefore it seemed preferable to maintain it 
  as an optional add-on rather than include it in the core MCP9802 Library itself.

                                       -------
                                VCC --| â€¢     |-- SDA
                                      |       |
                                GND --|       |
                                      |       |
                              ALERT --|       |-- SCL
                                       -------

   PIN 1 -    Connect VCC to the Arduino's 5V output
   PIN 2 -    Connect GND to the Arduino's GND
   PIN 3 -    This pin can be left unconnected for the purpose of running this sketch.
   PIN 4 -    Conntect SCL to the Arduino's PIN A5 with a 2K2 pull-up resistor
   PIN 5 -    Conntect SDA to the Arduino's PIN A4 with a 2K2 pull-up resistor
   DECOUPING: Connect a 0.1uF Ceramic Capacitor between the MCP9802's VCC & GND PINS

  I2C ADDRESSES
  -------------
  Each MCP9802 has 1 of 8 possible I2C addresses (factory hardwired & recognized by its specific part number & top marking 
  on the package itself):
 
    PART               DEVICE I2C ADDRESS          PART
   NUMBER          (BIN)      (HEX)     (DEC)     MARKING
  MCP9802A0       1001000      0x48       72       JKNN
